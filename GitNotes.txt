What is Git?

Git is a version control system (VCS) that helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and maintain different versions of a project. 
Git is a command-line tool that runs locally on your computer.

Example of Git:
Imagine you’re writing a book.

Without Git: If you make changes, you might save different copies like book_v1.docx, book_v2.docx, final_book.docx, etc. This gets messy.
With Git: Git automatically tracks changes, so you don’t need multiple copies. You can always go back to previous versions easily.

What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git. It provides a user-friendly interface for hosting, sharing, and collaborating on Git repositories.

Example of GitHub: (One example of Remote repository Service)   
Imagine you and a friend are writing the book together.
You both work on different chapters and save them using Git.
Instead of emailing files, you upload them to GitHub.
GitHub helps you merge changes smoothly.
